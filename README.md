# FFI Integration of Rust Code to Node.js App

This project demonstrates the integration of Rust code into a Node.js application using Foreign Function Interface (FFI) techniques. It showcases how to utilize Rust's performance and safety benefits within a Node.js project, allowing developers to implement critical components in Rust while managing the rest of the application in JavaScript.

## Introduction

In the realm of modern web applications, achieving a balance between high-level, developer-friendly languages like JavaScript and low-level languages like Rust becomes crucial. This project provides a template for achieving such integration by demonstrating how to build, package, and utilize Rust code within a Node.js application. By offloading computationally intensive tasks to Rust, developers can attain improved execution times and enhanced memory management.

## Setup

1. Ensure that Rust and Node.js are installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/ffi-rust-nodejs.git`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd ffi-rust-nodejs`
4. Install Rust dependencies: `cargo build`
5. Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Build the Rust code: `cargo build --release`
2. Run the Node.js application: `node app.js`

The Node.js application will leverage FFI to call Rust functions, seamlessly integrating Rust functionality into the application.

## Tests

This project incorporates unit tests for both Rust and Node.js components. To run the tests:

- Rust: `cargo test`
- Node.js: `npm test`

The tests ensure the correctness of the Rust integration and verify the expected behavior of the Node.js application.

## Benchmarks

Benchmarks play a crucial role in evaluating the performance enhancements derived from utilizing Rust. The project includes benchmarking scripts to compare execution times between Rust and JavaScript implementations for specific tasks.

To execute the benchmarks:

- Rust: `cargo bench`
- Node.js: `npm run benchmark`
